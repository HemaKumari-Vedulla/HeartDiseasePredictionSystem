Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning<br>
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease using Logistic Regression.<br>
The model is trained using three key medical features: Cholesterol, Resting Blood Pressure, and Chest Pain Type.<br>

<b>Project Overview<br>
Loads and preprocesses the heart.csv dataset<br>
Encodes categorical data using LabelEncoder<br>
Scales features using StandardScaler<br>
Splits data into training and testing sets<br>
Trains a Logistic Regression model<br>
Accepts user input and predicts heart disease<br>
