<b>Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning<br></b>
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease using Logistic Regression.<br>
The model is trained using three key medical features: Cholesterol, Resting Blood Pressure, and Chest Pain Type.<br>

<b>Project Overview : <br></b>
1.Loads and preprocesses the heart.csv dataset<br>
2.Encodes categorical data using LabelEncoder<br>
3.Scales features using StandardScaler<br>
4.Splits data into training and testing sets<br>
5.Trains a Logistic Regression model<br>
6.Accepts user input and predicts heart disease<br>
